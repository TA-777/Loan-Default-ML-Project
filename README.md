# Loan-and-credit-Default-ML-Project
Building and evaluating three classification models to determine whether a client defaults on a loan or not.
This project compares Logistic Regression, KNN, and Naive Bayes on an imbalanced loan dataset.  
Focus is on handling class imbalance, model evaluation, and interpretability.
A logistic regression model is built for the credit card default dataset as well as an artificial neural network using Keras, in order to compare the performance of the two models
